Before you can run this software, you must include a couple 
extra libraries:
    1) mysql-connector-java-8.0.28.jar (Connector/J 8.0.28)
        a) You can get this by downloading the MySQL Installer
           from the following link: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/
        b) In the installer application, find the connector with the
           title in the above lines and follow the process to install it.
        c) Add it to the external libraries folder of your project
    2)  itextpdf-5.5.12.2.jar
        a) Download the jar file from the following link:
           http://www.java2s.com/example/jar/i/download-itextpdf5512jar-file.html
        b) Add the jar file to the external libraries folder of your
           project

Now that you have the libraries installed, you should be able to run
the application from the main in the UserInterface class.

It is possible that you may run into some issues when trying to
connect to the cloud database because of permissions issues. If
this is the case, please notify one of the developers so they can
whitelist your IP (although this should be taken care of).
