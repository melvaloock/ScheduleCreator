To run this software, you will have to ensure that Gradle is
installed on your computer. You can download it from the Gradle website:
https://gradle.org/install/

Since this software ships with the build.gradle file, most of the
dependencies are already present. However, you will have to install
the following dependencies if they do not appear in the lib folder of
your Java project:
    1) mysql-connector-java-8.0.28.jar (Connector/J 8.0.28)
        a) You can get this by downloading the MySQL Installer
           from the following link: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/
        b) In the installer application, find the connector with the
           title in the above lines and follow the process to install it.
        c) Add it to the external libraries folder of your project
    2)  itextpdf-5.5.12.2.jar
        a) Download the jar file from the following link:
           http://www.java2s.com/example/jar/i/download-itextpdf5512jar-file.html
        b) Add the jar file to the external libraries folder of your
           project

From Windows Powershell, run the following command in the root
of the project after installing Gradle:
./gradlew bootRun
